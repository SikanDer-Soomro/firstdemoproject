Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

1. First list item
    - First nested list item
    - Second nested list item
    
Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] Finish my changes
- [x] Push my commits to GitHub
- [x] Open a pull request
